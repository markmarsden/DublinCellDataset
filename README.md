# Domain Adaptation In Vision-based Object Counting

This project investigates domain adaptation in object count regression. As part of this work a new cell counting dataset in the context of tissue culture and cell diagnosis, referred to as the Dublin Cell Counting dataset is made available to the research community.

Further details on this project can be found in our paper "People, Penguins and Petri Dishes: Adapting Object Counting Models To New Visual Domains And Object Types Without Forgetting" https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10698
